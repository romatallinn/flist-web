# Flist Web App

[![Flist](https://flist.me/css/favicons/android-icon-72x72.png)](https://flist.me)

Website: https://flist.me

Profile Page Example: http://flist.me/u/rsirokov

Flist is my personal open-source project. It is intended to help you in keeping all your social contacts at one place so you can easily share them at once with people you meet. The platform allows you to create a profile, which you then fill with the list of any contacts that you want to share; from large social networks such as Facebook, to emails and phone numbers, and to your profiles at small thematic forums. In short, you create your own profile in the online contact book.

### Project

This specific repository is dedicated to the web application of Flist. The web application consists of two separated parts: [the landing page](https://flist.me) and the dynamic user's profile page ([example](https://flist.me/u/rsirokov)). 

The backend functionality heavily relies on [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

### TODO
   - **Unite**: unite two separate parts into one seamless application.
   - **Backend Improvements**: replace the content load from on-client JS to on-server.
   - **Django**: create a solid Django project?

### Acknowledgement
The landing page is based on a great looking web app theme [New Age](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-new-age) by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
